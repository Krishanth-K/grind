# DSA Grind & Coursework Solutions

Welcome to my repository of **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** practice â€” a personal grind combining:

* âœ… **LeetCode & other problem-solving platforms**
* âœ… **Coursework & assignments from my DSA curriculum**

This repo is a reflection of my **daily/weekly commitment** to mastering algorithms, problem-solving techniques, and DSA patterns.

## ðŸš€ How to Navigate

* `leetcode/`: Self-practice and platform-based problems categorized by topic.
* `coursework/`: Problems given by my professor as part of academic DSA training, organized by week/session.

---

## ðŸ”Ž Problem-Solving Approach

* âœ… Start by understanding the problem constraints & edge cases.
* âœ… Solve iteratively or recursively as needed.
* âœ… Optimize where possible (time & space complexity).
* âœ… Add comments to explain logic.
* âœ… Reflect on patterns like:

  * Two Pointers
  * Sliding Window
  * Divide & Conquer
  * Recursion & Backtracking
  * Dynamic Programming

---

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

* Language: **Python / C++ / Java** (mention what you mostly use)
* Tools: Local editor + LeetCode, GeeksForGeeks, etc.

---

## ðŸ“… Commit Frequency

I commit my solutions **daily or weekly** to keep track of my consistency and learning progress.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Disclaimer

This repository is a **learning and practice log**, and some solutions may be improved or refactored over time.

---

If you'd like, I can generate:

* A **dynamic progress tracker** in markdown you can update easily.
* A **bash script to auto-generate the folder structure** if your topics grow.

Let me know!
